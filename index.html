<h2>Bio</h2>

<p><img border="0" align="Left" style="float:left;" src="pic.png" width="120"> My name is Tommy Schneider. I have a Bachelor of Science from Harvey Mudd College where I studied math, physics, and computer science. I have five years of tutoring experience at the college and high-school level. In addition to teaching, my passions include playing chess and writing comedic fiction. Right now, I am working part-time at the Redmond Mathnasium and am saving money to obtain a teaching certification in Washington State.
</p>


<h2>Approach</h2>
<p>
My approach to teaching is compassionate and flexible. I firmly believe mistakes are a necessary part of the learning process. Having the chance to explore new and unfamiliar ideas alongside an experienced instructor is one of the best ways to learn and achieve long-lasting success. In addition to helping students with particular exams and assignments, I work to identify and fill knowledge gaps and help the student develop a general approach to technical problem solving.
</p>

<h2>Subjects</h2>
<p>
I have a strong background in mathematics, and can teach Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II, Precalculus, Calculus, Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Real Analysis, Abstract Algebra, and much more! I’ve also tutored college-level physics courses, including Classical Mechanics and Electricity and Magnetism.
</p>

<h2>Pricing</h2>
<p>
My pricing generally depends on circumstance (how much time I need to spend preparing, commute, etc.), but is generally in the $30-$50/hour range. However, <em>the first lesson is always free</em>. The best way to see if we’d be a good fit is to setup a session and see!
</p>

<h2>Location and Contact Information</h2>
<p>
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, my tutoring sessions are all online. 
	
Otherwise, I generally meet with students at the Redmond Library or the UW Campus Library.
